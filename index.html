    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Austin, Texas, I have spent my whole life loving tacos, 
      live music, and swimming. In my free time, you can find me in the pool, 
      playing the string bass, baking bread and pastries, reading the news, or 
      playing the latest New York Times word game. I love doing activities with 
      other people, and this translates into seeing a ton of artists in concert, 
      going on hikes, and playing ping pong frequently. I am a current Stanford 
      student studying Symbolic Systems (Stanford’s flavor of cognitive science) 
      with a minor in Education. I am writing my Honors Thesis in Education, and 
      I am interested in pursuing my PhD in the Learning Sciences. In the future, 
      I hope to focus my research on incorporating technology and game design into 
      the classroom to facilitate creativity and imaginative play in children.</p>
